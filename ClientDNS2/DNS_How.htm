DNS (Domain Name System) is the heart of the Internet service, and is perhaps 
the most misunderstood part of it. You could not find your favorite Web page 
without it. There are actually 2 types of DNS service, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IPV4</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IPV6</a>. Since IPV6 is 
not widely used yet, we will restrict our discussions to IPV4.</P>
<P>
When you enter your favorite <a href="http://www.sharpened.net/glossary/definition.php?url">URL </a> 
or recover it from your shortcuts (eg. http://www.yellowhead.com/), your 
computer has no idea where to look for that page. The Internet works with 
numbers, not text, and it must be translated (http://[24.65.44.238]/) before 
it can be used. This is the function of the DNS service.</P>

<P>
DNS service is usually provided by your ISP, although I have shown the 
OpenDNS servers below. IF you are using Windows, you can go to the command 
prompt and enter the command:
<PRE>
C:\>ipconfig /all

DNS servers are supposed to accept both 
<a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/udp">UDP</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP </a> 
requests, but TCP requests are not universally accepted because some routers 
and firewalls do not pass along the TCP requests on port 53. UDP packets are 
limited in size (512 bytes), and delivery is not assured because there is no 
connection established. Therefore, the requesting computer will have to wait 
for the request to time out. When it times out on one server, it switches to 
the other. Why they use the names Primary and Secondary is not fully understood, 
as your computer will use whichever one it last had success with. For that 
reason it is not advisable to configure more than 2 DNS servers, as it will 
have to time out on all configured servers on a bad lookup, and that could 
result in a long wait.</P>
<P>
The DNS protocol is very compact and highly cryptic, so for this
discussion I will use screen shots from a program that I wrote called 
Client DNS. When this program is loaded, it finds the default DNS servers:</P>
<center>

<IMG SRC="ClientDNS1.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
In this case, there is only one DNS server listed because I am using a 
NAT (Network Address Translation) router as DNS. It simply relays the 
requests to one of the DNS servers that it has in its own configuration. 
When you enter the domain name to translate, click on a server name, and 
click the "Send Query" button:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="DNSRecur1.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
There is a lot of information in the header. First of all, it tells us that 
this is not an authoratative answer (Authoritative Answer = False). That is 
because this server does not host this particular domain, and 
<a href="http://www.simpledns.com/help/v50/df_recursion.htm">recursion </a> 
was requested and utilized to find the answer. This will be explained in 
more detail later. It also tells us that there were no errors and 1 
Question (QDCount=1), 1 Answer (ANCount=1), 2 Nameserver (NSCount=2), and 
1 Additional (ARCount=1) records received. Our ClientDNS program displays 
each of those record types on separate tabs. Clicking on the Question TAB:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="DNSRecur2.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
Clicking on the Answer TAB:</P>

<center>
<IMG SRC="DNSRecur3.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
And the Authority TAB:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="DNSRecur4.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
And the Additional TAB:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="DNSRecur5.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
But that is only part of the answer. Where does your listed DNS server get 
the answer from? To answer that question, we will follow the recursive 
procedure that your DNS server uses. Every domain name must be registered 
at one of the many Domain Registrars. The part of the domain behind the 
last dot indicates the high level domain, and the root servers will tell 
us where to find the servers that serve that particular high level domain 
(eg. com). Clicking on the "Root Servers" button loads the high level 
servers which are always in cache:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS2.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>

<P>
By selecting one of those servers and sending a query, we can examine 
the header:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS3.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
<P>
Notice that these servers do not use recursion and do not provide the 
answer for us, but instead point us to 13 other Nameservers:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS4.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
with their location:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS5.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>

Selecting one of those and querying again:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS6.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
Notice that these servers also do not provide recursion, and again do not 
provide the answer, but instead point us to the actual authoratative 
Nameservers:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS7.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
Selecting one of those and sending a query:</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS8.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
<P>
finally provides us with an authoratative answer:</P>

<center>
<IMG SRC="ClientDNS9.jpg" align=CENTRE,BORDER=0></center>
<P>
MAN, WHAT A LOT OF WORK TO ANSWER A SIMPLE QUESTION. But you can see that 
when you register a domain, you are simply registering which DNS servers 
are being utilized to host that domain. Once your own DNS server has aquired 
the answer, it usually adds it to cache. How long does it remain in cache? 
Once again, the answer is not straight forward. The original query provided 
a TTL (Time To Live). The DNS server will generally use this number as the 
refresh timeout, but it is not under any obligation to do so. It can set 
its own minimum or maximum timeout. When the timeout has been decremented 
to zero without being called upon again (refreshed), it is deleted from cache.</P>
